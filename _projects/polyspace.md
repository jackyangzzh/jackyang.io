## Description

Poly Space VR is a low poly, lightweight, open-source social platform where you can meet and chat with your friends in VR. You can create and share your own Poly Spaces by following the guidelines.

## Inspiration

When I played VRChat, I noticed that the giant platform is great for meeting random people but not so much for intimate or customized experiences. After some research, I realized there is no VR social media platform targeted for small groups, so I created one myself. Due to the size of the project, I chose to make it open source and lightweight so that other developers who share the vision can contribute.
