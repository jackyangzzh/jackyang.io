## Description

Poly Space VR is a low-poly, lightweight, open-source social platform where you can meet and chat with friends in VR. You can create and share your own Poly Spaces by following our guidelines.

## Inspiration

While playing VRChat, I noticed that the platform excels at connecting strangers but lacks features for intimate, customized experiences. After researching the VR social landscape, I realized there was no platform specifically designed for small groups, so I created one. To make the project scalable and accessible, I made it open source and lightweight, enabling other developers who share this vision to contribute.
