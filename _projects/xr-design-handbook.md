XR Design Handbook is a compilation of XR design guidelines from numerous leading companies in the field.

## Description
The repository contains a compilation of XR design guidelines from numerous leading companies in the field. This is a goldmine for both seasoned designers and newcomers to XR, ensuring we can create user-friendly and effective experiences.

## Inspiration
I've been noticing that while there are myriad AR/VR design guidelines spread across various companies and platforms, there hasn't been a consolidated place where we can see them all together. Recognizing this gap, I took the initiative to start this project.
