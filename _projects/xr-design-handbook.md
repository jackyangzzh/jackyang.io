XR Design Handbook is an open-source compilation of XR design guidelines from industry leaders. What started as my personal notebook for Microsoft Mesh research has evolved into a living resource for the broader XR community.

## What's Inside

- Side-by-side comparisons of locomotion, input, and comfort recommendations from Meta, Apple, Microsoft, Google, Niantic, and more.
- Pattern write-ups distilled from public docs, conference talks, and field notes from building on Microsoft Mesh—all tagged so contributors can cross-reference scenarios quickly.
- Links to canonical PDFs, WWDC/Build sessions, and academic papers so designers can go from inspiration to implementation without guesswork.

## How I Maintain It

- Track vendor documentation changelogs and log issues whenever new guidelines drop so the repository stays current.
- Curate community pull requests, ensuring citations are included and insights map to a consistent taxonomy.
- Publish release notes that highlight major additions and tie them to real-world use cases (training, productivity, entertainment, accessibility).

## Why It Exists

Guidelines are scattered across PDFs, web pages, and slide decks, which makes them hard to compare. I created this project to centralize the best references so the XR community can design faster, learn from peers, and avoid reinventing patterns. The handbook also saves me time when I need to justify design decisions on Microsoft Mesh—each pattern links back to research or industry precedent.
