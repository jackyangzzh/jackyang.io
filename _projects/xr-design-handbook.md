XR Design Handbook is a compilation of XR design guidelines from numerous leading companies in the field.

## Description

The repository contains a comprehensive compilation of XR design guidelines from numerous leading companies in the field including Meta (Oculus), Apple (Vision Pro), Microsoft (HoloLens), Google (ARCore), and many others. This is a goldmine for both seasoned designers and newcomers to XR, ensuring we can create user-friendly and effective immersive experiences.

## Inspiration

I've been noticing that while there are myriad XR design guidelines spread across various companies and platforms, there hasn't been a consolidated place where we can see them all together. Recognizing this gap, I took the initiative to start this open-source project to help the XR community access quality design resources in one centralized location.
