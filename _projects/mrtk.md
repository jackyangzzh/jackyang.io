MRTK is a Unity toolkit used for developing XR content.

## Description

In this open source project, I work with Microsoft developers and other open-source contributors on MRTK for Unity. Some of the features I worked on are integrating Leap Motion Hand Tracking with MRTK (see demo video above) and adding new features for the upcoming MRTK 2.7.
