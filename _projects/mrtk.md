MRTK is a Unity toolkit for developing XR content.

## Description

In this open-source project, I collaborate with Microsoft developers and other contributors on MRTK for Unity. Key features I developed include integrating Leap Motion hand tracking with MRTK and implementing new capabilities for MRTK 2.7.
