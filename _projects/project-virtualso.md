Project Virtualso combines artificial intelligence (AI), natural language processing (NLP), and virtual reality to create customizable conversational humanoid agents capable of making emotion-driven facial expressions and body gestures.

## Inspiration

This project combines my expertise in communication arts and VR to create realistic human interactions in virtual reality. During COVID-19, many people lost access to in-person interactions and opportunities to develop essential soft skills. In response, I created several training simulations, including job interviews and public speaking scenarios.

## Virtual Interview

Users are interviewed by a conversational humanoid agent capable of holding natural conversations and engaging in realistic emotion-driven interactions, including facial expressions and body gestures, powered by Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

## Virtual Presentation

Users present their slides in front of a virtual audience of AI agents capable of reacting realistically to the presentation. This simulation aims to help individuals overcome public speaking anxiety and has been tested by professionals from various companies with overwhelmingly positive feedback.
