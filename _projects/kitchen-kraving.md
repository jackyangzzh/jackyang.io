Kitchen Kraving is a frantic VR kitchen sim I built at Carnegie Mellon with a small team of artists, programmers, and sound designers. It was my first shipped title, and it helped shape my later UX work on XR training systems.

## Gameplay Loop

- Players juggle multiple recipes, prep stations, and plating timers under constant time pressure.
- A mischievous twist lets you sneak bites of food to keep stamina up, but you risk getting caught by the boss during surprise inspections.
- Haptic cues, spatial audio, and exaggerated hand animations keep the experience playful even when the kitchen chaos escalates.

## My Role

- Programmed VR interactions, tactile feedback, and gesture recognizers that determine whether food is being prepped or secretly eaten.
- Built the kitchen state machine that orchestrates orders, timers, boss check-ins, and scoring—ensuring the pace scales with the player's proficiency.
- Collaborated with artists on shader tuning and lighting passes to maintain 90 FPS on Oculus Rift DK2 hardware.

## Outcomes

- Demoed during Carnegie Mellon ETC showcases and later published on the Oculus Store as a free download for Rift DK2 owners.
- Gained hands-on experience with co-located VR ergonomics that I later reused when prototyping shared experiences at Holos and Microsoft.
