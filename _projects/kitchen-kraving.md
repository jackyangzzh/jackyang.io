Kitchen Kraving is a frantic VR kitchen sim I built at Carnegie Mellon with a small team of artists, programmers, and sound designers. It was my first shipped title and set the foundation for my later UX work on XR training systems.

## Gameplay Loop

- Players juggle multiple recipes, prep stations, and plating timers under constant time pressure.
- A mischievous twist lets you sneak bites of food to keep stamina up, but you risk getting caught by the boss during surprise inspections.
- Haptic cues, spatial audio, and exaggerated hand animations keep the experience playful even when the kitchen chaos escalates.

## My Role

- Programmed hand-tracking interactions, tactile feedback, and the gesture recognizers that determine whether food is being prepped or secretly eaten.
- Built the kitchen state machine that orchestrates orders, timers, boss check-ins, and scoring, ensuring the pace scales with the player's proficiency.
- Collaborated with artists on shader tuning and lighting passes to maintain 90 FPS on Oculus Rift DK2 hardware.

## Outcome

- Demoed during Carnegie Mellon ETC showcases and later published on the Oculus Store as a free download for Rift DK2 owners.
- Provided hands-on learnings about multiplayer kitchen ergonomics that I reused when prototyping co-located experiences at Holos and Microsoft.
